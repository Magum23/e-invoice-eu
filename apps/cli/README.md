## Description

This package contains the commandline interface of `@e-invoice-eu/core`
installed as `e-invoice-eu`. It uses the E-Invoice-EU core library
[`@e-invoice-eu/core`](https://github.com/gflohr/e-invoice-eu/tree/main/packages/core)
internally.

## Features

The program can create e-invoices in the following formats:

- Cross Industry Invoice - CII
- Universal Business Language - UBL
- Factur-X/ZUGFeRD (all profiles including XRECHNUNG) with full PDF/A support

E-Invoices can be created directly from data in the [E-Invoice-EU internal
format](https://gflohr.github.io/e-invoice-eu/en/docs/details/internal-format/)
or via a [mapping definition](https://gflohr.github.io/e-invoice-eu/en/docs/details/mapping/)
from popular spreadsheet formats like `.ods`, `.xlsx`, `.csv`, ...

## Documentation

The general documentation of `e-invoice-eu` is available at the
[`e-invoice-eu` GitHub page](https://github.com/gflohr/e-invoice-eu/tree/main/packages/core).
For reference, you can also consult the
[API documentation](https://gflohr.github.io/e-invoice-eu/api-docs/).

## Installation

```sh
npm install -g @e-invoice-eu/cli
```

You can test that the installation has worked with the command `e-invoice-eu
--version`. The output should be the version number of the installed software.

| Name              | Argument | Description                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| -f, --format      | `string` | a [supported format](https://gflohr.github.io/e-invoice-eu/en/docs/basics/supported-formats/) |
| -o, --output      | `string` | write output to specified file instead of standard output                                     |
| -i, --invoice     | `string` | JSON file with invoice data, mandatory for invoice generation from JSON                       |
| -m, --mapping     | `string` | YAML or JSON file with mapping, mandatory for invoice generation from spreadsheet data        |
| -d, --data        | `string` | invoice spreadsheet file, mandataory for invoice generation from spreadsheet data             |
| -l, --lang        | `string` | a language identifier like `fr-fr`                                                            |
| --embedPDF        |          | use if a PDF version should be embedded into XML output                                       |
| -p, --pdf         | `string` | a PDF version of the invoice                                                                  |
| --pdf-id          | `string` | ID of the embedded PDF, defaults to the document number; ignored for Factur-X/ZUGFeRD         |
| --pdf-description | `string` | optional description of the embedded PDF; ignored for Factur-X/ZUGFeRD                        |
| -a, --attachment  | `string` | optional name of an additional attachment                                                     |
| --attachment-id   | `string` |

#### Argument `format`

This contains the format of the e-invoice as a case-insensitive string. You
can also use aliases. For example, `Factur-X-Comfort` is an alias for
`Factur-X-EN16931`.

#### Argument `lang`

A language identifier like `fr-fr`. This is only used for the Factur-X/ZUGFeRD
formats for some canned texts in the PDF XMP meta data.

#### Argument `embedPDF`

This is only used for the pure XML formats (everything that is not
Factur-X/ZUGFeRD). If it has a truthy value, a PDF version of the invoice
is embedded as a base64 encoded string in the XML.

#### Argument `pdf`

This is required in two cases:

1. The format is a Factur-X/ZUGFeRD format and `data` was **not** specified.
2. The format is a pure XML format, `embedPDF` was specified and `data` was not specified.

#### Argument `data`

A spreadsheet version of the invoice. If a PDF is required, either because
embedPDF was specified for pure XML or because the format is Factur-X/ZUGFeRD,
[LibreOffice](https://libreoffice.org) is invoked for rendering the spreadsheet
as a PDF.

This feature will trigger an exception if used in the browser.

#### Argument `attachments`

You can specify an arbitrary number of additional attachments.

In case of the pure XML formats, they are embedded as base64 encoded strings
in the XML. In case of Factur-X/ZUGFeRD they are attached to the PDF,
additionally to the mandatory attachment `factur-x.xml`.

### Getting Supported Formats

```typescript
import { FormatFactoryService } from '@e-invoice-eu/core';

const factoryService = new FormatFactoryService();
const formats = factoryService.listFormatServices();
```

In `format` you will find an array of
[`FormatInfo`](https://gflohr.github.io/e-invoice-eu/api-docs/types/FormatInfo.html)
objects.

### Getting the JSON Schema Definitions

```typescript
import { invoiceSchema, mappingSchema } from '@e-invoice-eu/core';
```

These variables contain the schema for the
[`Invoice`](https://gflohr.github.io/e-invoice-eu/api-docs/types/Invoice.html)
and [`Mapping`](https://gflohr.github.io/e-invoice-eu/api-docs/types/Mapping.html)
interfaces. These schemas can be passed as an argument to the compile method of an Ajv instance, see https://ajv.js.org/api.html#ajv-compile-schema-object-data-any-boolean-promise-any for more information!

The schemas have the type
[`JSONSchemaType<Invoice>`](https://ajv.js.org/guide/typescript.html#utility-types-for-schemas)
and
[`JSONSchemaType<Mapping>`](https://ajv.js.org/guide/typescript.html#utility-types-for-schemas)
respectively.
