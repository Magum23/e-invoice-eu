# Templates

This directory contains invoice templates that can be used to create invoice
from spreadsheet files.  You can use the mappings provided in
[../mappings](../mappings/README.md) for testing the conversions.

The PDF files are print versions of the invoices. They are *not* in
Factur-X/ZUGFeRD format! Their intended use is to test the attachment of PDF
versions or to test Factur-X/ZUGFeRD generation where a user-provided PDF
is used as the wrapper (opposed to the normal mode of generation where the
PDF is created from the invoice spreadsheet).
