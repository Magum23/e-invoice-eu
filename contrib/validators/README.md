# Validators

It is strongly recommended that you validate the invoices that you issue to
make sure that your customers can process them.

This directory contains wrapper scripts for two popular offline validators,
[Mustang project](https://github.com/ZUGFeRD/mustangproject) and the validator
of the German [Koordinierungsstelle f√ºr IT-Standards -
KoSIT](https://www.xoev.de/).

Please see the [E-Invoice-EU documentation about e-invoice
validation](http://localhost:3000/e-invoice-eu/en/docs/details/validation/)
for more information.
