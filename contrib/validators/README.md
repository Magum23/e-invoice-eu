# Validators

It is strongly recommended that you validate the invoices that you issue to
make sure that your customers can process them.

## Factur-X/ZUGFeRD

### Online Validator

The following online validators are freely available:

- portinvoice: https://www.portinvoice.com/
- ZUGFeRD Community (requires registration): https://www.zugferd-community.net/en/login
- FNFE Service Validator (requires registration): https://services.fnfe-mpe.org/

Please create an [issue](https://github.com/gflohr/e-invoice-eu) if you want to
add another freely available validator.

### Offline Validation

[Mustang project](https://github.com/ZUGFeRD/mustangproject) offers validation
of Factur-X/ZUGFeRD and XRECHNUNG documents. You need a Java Runtime
Environment for using it.

If you have Java installed, download the `Mustang-CLI-*VERSION*.jar from their
[release page](https://github.com/ZUGFeRD/mustangproject/releases) and save
it as `Mustang-CLI.jar`in the directory`contrib/validators/factur-x`.

After that you can validate Factur-X/ZUGFeRD like this:

```shell
$ node contrib/validators/factur-x/factur-x-validate.mjs INVOICE_DOCUMENT
```

In case of an error, you will get a detailed error report which is
unfortunately not very easy to understand.

You can pass PDF documents with embedded e-invoices and also bare XML files.
The validator also supports documents following the German XRECHNUNG standard.
Check the [Mustangproject homepage](https://www.mustangproject.org/) for
up-to-date information.

If you haven't installed the Java interpreter in your `$PATH`, you can set
the environment variable `$JAVA` to the location of the Java executable.
Likewise. you can point the environment variable `$MUSTANG_CLI_JAR` to the
location of the Mustangproject Jar file if it cannot be found at
`contrib/factur-x/Mustang-CLI.jar`.

## UBL/CII/XRECHNUNG

### Online Validation

- portinvoice: https://www.portinvoice.com
- EPO Consulting Validator: https://www.epoconsulting.com/erechnung-sap/xrechnung-validator
- Invoice Portal XRechnung https://invoice-portal.de/en/peppol-bis-xrechnung-validator/
- Ecosio: https://ecosio.com/de/peppol-und-xml-dokumente-online-validieren/

### Offline Validation

The German [Koordinierungsstelle f√ºr IT-Standards -
KoSIT](https://www.xoev.de/) maintains a free and open source validator for
arbitrary e-invoice formats.

You need a Java Runtime Environment (version 11 or newer) and download at
least two pieces of software, the actual validator and a so-called
"validation scenario" with the schemas of the supported formats.

#### Install Validator

Download the file `validator-*VERSION*-distribution.zip`. It contains a file
`validationtool-*VERSION*-standalone.jar`. Save it as `validationtool.jar`
in the directory `contrib/validators/kosit`.

Please try out that you can run the validator executable with this command:

```shell
$ java -jar contrib/validators/kosit/validationtool.jar
```

It should display a help page with usage information.

#### Install XRECHNUNG Scenario

A "scenario" for XRECHNUNG is available at https://github.com/itplr-kosit/validator-configuration-xrechnung/releases.

Download the file `validator-configuration-xrechnung_*VERSION*_*DATE*.zip`
and unpack it in the directory `contrib/validators/kosit/xrechnung-scenario`.
This should now work:

```shell
$ ls contrib/validators/kosit/xrechnung-scenario/scenarios.xml
```

This scenario contains schemas for UBL, CII, and various versions of the
German XRECHNUNG format.

#### Run the Validator

Now you can run the validator like this:

```shell
$ node contrib/validators/kosit/validate.mjs invoice.pdf
```

You will see the result of the validation on the console. Additionally, a
file `*INVOICE_DOCUMENT*-report.xml` will be generated with a detailed
validation report and a visualization of the invoice. Despite the filename
extension `.xml`, the report is an HTML file and can be displayed in the
browser.

You can pass multiple files on the commandline if you want to validate
more than one document at once.

Alternatively, you can start the validator as a daemon:

```shell
$ node contrib/validators/kosit/validate.mjs --daemon
```

The option `-D` is an alias for `--daemon`.

You can now open a web interface at http://localhost:8080/ and upload invoices
to be validated.

Alternatively, you can use `curl`:

```shell
$ curl POST -d @./invoice.xml http://localhost:8080/
```

For complete usage information of the validator, run this command:

```shell
$ node contrib/validators/kosit/validate.mjs --help
```

Note that the wrapper script always passes the mandatory arguments `--scenarios`
and `--repository`.
