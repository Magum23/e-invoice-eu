# Qgoda-Site

This directory holds the documentation files generated by
[Qgoda](https://www.qgoda.net/).

GitHub pages wants to have all files under `/docs` but automatically adds
a prefix `/e-invoice-eu`. Therefore `/docs` is a symlink to
`/qgoda-site/e-invoice-eu`. In other words: Just ignore this directory and
rather read the docs at https://gflohr.github.com/e-invoice-eu/.
