Case does not matter, when you specify a format.

### Other UBL and CII Variants

There are a lot of variants of UBL and CII in use. See
https://peppol.helger.com/public/locale-en_US/menuitem-validation-ws2
for an overview. The only real difference to the vanilla UBL and CII formats
generated by e-invoice-eu are a so called customization and sometimes also
a profile ID. If you have to support one of these formats, all you have to
do is to specify "UBL" or "CII" as the format and provide the respective values
either in the invoice data or hardcode them into your mapping.

Hardcoding them into the mapping is easy:

```yaml
# ...
ubl: Invoice
  cbc:CustomizationID: urn:cen.eu:en16931:2017#conformant#urn:fdc:peppol.eu:2017:poacc:billing:international:aunz:3.0
  cbc:ProfileID: urn:fdc:peppol.eu:2017:poacc:billing:01:1.0
# ...
```

This would for example create an A-NZ Peppol BIS3 Invoice 1.0.11 UBL invoice.
Note that you always have to specify exactly these fields, even for CII
variants. The ids will be mapped into their respective CII counterparts by the
service.

The formats "XRechnung-UBL" and "XRechnung-CII" are just convenience formats
for Germany. The only difference to vanilla UBL and vanilla CII are the
customization IDs. If you think that another format should also be added for
convenience, file an issue.

It is the user's responsability to meet other requirements of that variant.
For example XRechnung-UBL requires that the otherwise optional field
`/ubl:Invoice/cbc:BuyerReference` (BT-10) is filled. This is something that
you have to ensure yourself in order to create a valid invoice.

### Missing Formats

Credit notes and other documents like orders are currently not supported and
support for it will require more effort.

EDI is also not supported. If you know of a tool that is able to convert
UBL or CII to EDI, please let us know!

### Security

The service in its current state is meant to be run in a network with limited
access or behind an API gateway that prevents abuse of the service.

One simple solution is to use [`ngninx`](https://nginx.org/) as a
gateway and configure rate-limiting there. You will also want to limit
the maximum request body size.

## Description

This repository is an attempt to aid small businesses, especially in France and Germany but also in other parts of the European Union to create electronic invoices conforming with EN16931 with only free and open-source software.

It is quite unlikely that you can use anything here out of the box. See it as a starter template for your own solution.

## Documentation

This `README.md` is probably incomplete. Please see the blog post
[Creating Electronic Invoices with Free and Open Source
Software](https://www.guido-flohr.net/creating-electronic-invoices-with-free-and-open-source-software/)
for more accurate in-depth information!

## Alternatives

You can achieve similar results with these projects:

- [Factur-X extension for LibreOffice](https://github.com/akretion/factur-x-libreoffice-extension)
  is a LibreOffice extension to generate Factur-X invoices from LibreOffice Calc published under the GPL licence with a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldD-1W8yIv0). It is maybe less flexible but easier to set up.

## Pre-requisites

- NodeJS 20.x
- A package manager like bun, npm, yarn, pnpm, ...

## Installation

```bash
$ bun install
```

This may warn about "husky" missing. Just run `bun install` again in order
to fix this.

If you do not like `bun`, replace it with `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm` or whatever
is currently hyped.

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ bun run start

# watch mode
$ bun run start:dev

# production mode
$ bun run start:prod
```

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ bun run test

# e2e tests
$ bun run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ bun run test:cov
```

## Running in a Container

By far the easiest way is to run the application in a software container.

Pull the Docker image:

```sh
$ docker pull gflohr/e-invoice-eu:latest
```

Run the container:

```sh
$ docker run --rm -d -p 3000:3000 --name e-invoice-eu gflohr/e-invoice-eu:1.0.0
```

If you want to debug issues, omit the option `-d` so that you can see the
output of the application running inside of the container.

Access the application from your host computer:

```sh
$ curl http://localhost:3000/api/format/list
```

## Curl Examples

The following assumes that you run the application with `start:dev` and the
API is exposed at http://localhost:3000.

### OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api
```

It probably makes more sense to open that URL in the browser.

### List Supported Formats

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:3000/api/format/list
```

This will return a list with format informat. For each format, the name,
the customization and profile ID, the MIME type, and the syntax (UBL or
CII) is returned.

### Transform Data from Spreadsheet

The application ships with a sample mapping in `contrib/mappings/default-invoice.yaml`.
You can use it with the spreadsheet data from
`contrib/templates/default-invoice.ods` like this:

```bash
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/invoice/transform-and-create/UBL \
	-F mapping=@contrib/mappings/default-invoice.yaml \
	-F data=@contrib/templates/default-invoice.ods
```

This will create invoice data in the internal format from a spreadsheet. The
intended target format is UBL.

The format parameter (`UBL` in this case) is case-insensitive!

### Create an Invoice from a Spreadsheet

```bash
$ curl -v -X POST \
    http://localhost:3000/api/invoice/transform-and-create/UBL \
    -F mapping=@contrib/mappings/default-invoice.yaml \
    -F data=@contrib/templates/default-invoice.ods
```

This will transform the spreadsheet into the internal format and immediately
create an invoice in format `UBL`.

### Full-Fledged Example

Say you want to add a PDF version `invoice.pdf` and two attachments
`time-sheet.ods` and `payment-terms.pdf` to the generated invoice:

```bash
$ curl -v -X POST \
    http://localhost:3000/api/invoice/transform-and-create/UBL \
    -F lang=de
    -F mapping=@contrib/mappings/default-invoice.yaml \
    -F data=@contrib/templates/default-invoice.ods \
    -F pdf=@invoice.pdf \
    -F embedPDF= \
    -F pdfID=1234567890 \
    -F pdfDescription="Invoice as PDF." \
    -F "attachment=@time-sheet.ods;type=application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.spreadsheet" \
		-F "attachmentID=abc-123-xyz" \
    -F attachmentDescription="Detailed description of hours spent." \
    -F attachment=@payment-terms.pdf \
    -F attachmentDescription="Our payment terms" \
```

The optional `lang` parameter specifies the language of the document. It
defaults to `en`. It is currently only used for the Factur-X variants where
certain canned texts are translated.

The parameter `embedPDF` should be passed if a PDF version of the document
should be embedded into the XML. It only makes sense if you have specified a
format that is _not_ Factur-X. Otherwise, it gets ignored. If you have uploaded a file `pdf` it
is taken. Otherwise, the file is generated with LibreOffice from the `data` file.
The parameter `pdfID` defaults to the document number.

Note that for the first supplementary attachment 'time-sheet.ods`, a MIME type
is explicitly specified because `curl` probably does not not the correct MIME
type of OpenDocument spreadsheet files.

For each supplementary attachment, an optional `description` and an optional
`id` can be specified. If the id is omitted, it defaults to the filename of
the attached file.

### Create an Invoice from JSON

The application ships with sample invoice data in `contrib/data/default-invoice.json`
that can be transformed into an e-invoice:

```bash
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/invoice/create/UBL \
	-F invoice=@contrib/data/default-invoice.json
```

The only differences to the `/api/invoice/transform-and-create` endpoint
described above are:

- You must upload a JSON file with invoice data in paramater `invoice`.
- The `data` parameter is optional. If you want to generate the PDF version for Factur-X/ZUGFeRD from a spreadsheet file, you should specify it here.

## Data Structure

The invoice document data structure is documented here:
https://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/billing/3.0/syntax/ubl-invoice/

If you prefer to have it all on one page, look here:
https://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/billing/3.0/syntax/ubl-invoice/tree/

A gentler introduction can be found here:
https://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/billing/3.0/bis/

## Validation

The service `e-invoice-eu` will ensure that the _structure_ of the invoices
you generate meets the requirements of the standard. That means that it
ensures the correct number of occurences and the correct order of all elements.

It is _your_ responsability to ensure the business requirements to the
invoice. Example: The software ensures that the invoice contains the tax
total but it is your responsability to ensure that the tax total is the sum
of the individual tax amounts.

Most of these business requirements are defined in business rules and it is
possible to check these requirements. This is called validation. See
[the overview on validation](contrib/validators/README.md) for more details
and how you can validate your invoices locally or by uploading them to
an invoice portal.

You should not ignore this! When you start creating electronic invoices it is
almost inevitable that they will contain errors that are detected by a
validator. Such invoices will be rejected by your customers and that costs
time and money on both sides.

## Mapping Syntax

Please see the [mapping documentation](documentation/Mapping.md)!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why are no Numbers Used in the JSON Schema?

Amounts have to be numbers >= 0 with at most two decimal places. The following
JSON schema should work for this:

```json
{
	"type": "number",
	"multipleOf": 0.01
}
```

This is even documented in the [JSON Schema
documentation](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/numeric#multiples).
Unfortunately, this does not work with the JavaScript implementation, see
https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/issues/652.

There are workarounds for this limitation of Ajv but I want to avoid people
naïvely validating against the schema with Ajv without applying the necessary
workaround. It looks simpler to require all amounts to be formatted
beforehand by the software that generates the input data.

The problem for percentages is the same only that percentages can have up
to four decimal digits.

For other numerical types, like quantities, we could use numbers but for
consistency we use strings throughout the schema.

### What Does the Warning 'ODS number format may be incorrect' Mean?

See [SheetJS GitHub issue #1569](https://github.com/SheetJS/sheetjs/issues/1569).
You can probably ignore this warning, unless you run into a problem with
number formats.

### Where Can I Get Information About Business Terms?

You will often see references to business terms in validation error messages.
You can look up to which elements they belong in the documentation
file [BusinessTerms.md](documentation/BusinessTerms.md).

### How Can I Suppress Auxiliary Sheets in the PDF Output?

Make sure that only the sheet that contains the printable invoice data has
a print range defined. You can check that with the menu entry
`Format -> Print Ranges -> Edit`. For all other sheets, all three options
have to be set to `None`.

## BUGS

### Report a Bug

Please report bugs at https://github.com/gflohr/e-invoice-eu/issues.

### PDF/A

The Factur-X resp. ZUGFeRD standard requires PDF/A compliance for the PDF that
the invoice is wrapped in. Please search the internet if you do not know what
PDF/A means.

This library creates PDFs solely with [`pdf-lib`](https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib)
and does some pretty complicated transformations on the PDF to achieve PDF/A
compliance. This is not battle tested and may fail.

If you encounter a PDF that does not meet the PDF/A requirements, please
open an issue and attach an anonymized version of the PDF. What you can do
in the meantime:

- If you have [GhostScript](https://www.ghostscript.com/) installed, convert the PDF to PDF/A with this command: `gs -dVERBOSE -dPDFA=3 -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=OUTPUT_FILE.pdf PDFA_def.ps INPUT_FILE.pdf`
- Try to create the PDF again with [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/).
- If the normal settings in LibreOffice do not work, enable PDF/A support (in the General section of the PDF options).
- If you want to automate the process, you can start LibreOffice in headless mode on the commandline: `libreoffice --headless "-env:UserInstallation=file:///tmp/LibreOffice_Conversion_${USER}" --convert-to 'pdf:writer_pdf_Export:{"SelectPdfVersion":{"type":"long","value":"3"}}' SOURCE_FILE.ods`

On Un\*x systems, `libreoffice` should be in your `$PATH`. On MacOS, you will
find it under `/Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/soffice`. On
MS Windows, it is probably somewhere like `C:\\Program Files\\LibreOffice\\libreoffice.exe` (corrections are welcome).
