### Ask Questions Naturally

Type your questions in plain language. For example:

- How do I create a UBL invoice?
- What is the difference between Factur-X and ZUGFeRD?
- Why should I validate electronic invoices?
- The validator complains about "An Invoice that contains a VAT breakdown group (BG-23) with a VAT category code (BT-118) "Not subject to VAT" shall not contain other VAT breakdown groups (BG-23)."

Especially the last example shows a very useful feature. The error messages
issued by validators are often hard to understand. The AI is able to translate
them into simpler language.

You can, of course, also ask other AIs like ChatGPT or Google Gemini. The
Google Notebook has the advantage that the context is already clear, and the
answers are maybe more specific to that context.

### Ask in Your Own Language

You can use any language you like for asking questions.
