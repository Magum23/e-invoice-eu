[% USE q = Qgoda %]
Both the commandline tool `e-invoice-eu` and the
[web service]([% q.llink(name='deployment') %]) use a common library
[`@e-invoice-eu/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@esgettext/runtime) as
their foundation. The library can be used to add e-invoice creation as a
feature to your own applications.

It comes with extensive <a href="/e-invoice-eu/api-docs" target="_blank">API
documentation<a> and a gentler introduction at
[its GitHub page](https://github.com/gflohr/e-invoice-eu/tree/main/packages/core).
