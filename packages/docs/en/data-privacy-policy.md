is collected related to your visit.

## Logging

Like most web sites, this site stores information about every request in a
server log file, a file stored on the web server. Visiting one single page
typically results in multiple requests, for textual content, images or other
media, script files, style sheets and so on.

### What Is Stored?

The following pieces of information sent by your browser are stored:

- Your IP address. This address identifies your computer or other device
  while you are connected to the internet. Your internet service provider
  (ISP) has the legal duty to store information about which IP address
  was assigned to which customer for a certain time in most countries.
- The date and time of the request with an accuracy of one second.
- The address of the resource.
- Information about the browser and operating systems you are using and
  their respective versions. See the documentation of your browser if you
  want to suppress sending that information.
- In case that you visited the page by clicking a link, information about
  the referring web site. See the documentation of your browser if you
  want to suppress sending that information.

All this information is stored for technical purposes only, such as analysis
of technial problems.

Note that suppressing your IP address does not make sense. Any server
needs it as the address to which it should send the requested data. The
purpose of the IP address is not to disrupt your privacy but it is needed
for any communication on the internet.

### How Long Is It Stored?

Log files are ultimately deleted after at most six months.

## Cookies
